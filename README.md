**Link to project:** 

## html || tailwind || node.js || cloudinary

## Lessons Learned

This was the first time I used Tailwind for styling which was a positive surprise. I also included image upload function with Cloudinary. As for the workflow I used github's project feature to map out ideas and plan my work.

## Optimizations

If I had more time I would have love to have added categories and sorting as well.
